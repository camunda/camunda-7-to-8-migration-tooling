# OpenRewrite recipes refactoring code from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8 

> [!NOTE]  
> The recipes are still under development. Feedback of course welcome. Expect recipes to work out-of-the-box only in simple scenarios, oftentimes you might want to extend them to suite your needs.
>
> **For users:** See the [official documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/code-conversion/#refactoring-recipes-using-openrewrite) for how to use the recipes in your project.

## Overview

This directory contains [OpenRewrite recipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes) for automated refactoring of Camunda 7 Java code to Camunda 8.

The recipes help automatically refactor:
- Client code using the Camunda 7 Java API
- Java delegates (glue code)
- External task workers
- Unit tests (work in progress)

Transformation examples can be found in the [code conversion patterns](../patterns/).

## Extending recipes

For many scenarios you might want to extend the recipes. For example, your Java Delegates might not implement ` org.camunda.bpm.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate` but extend your own superclass `org.acme.MyJavaDelegate`. This would not be picked up by the out-of-the-box recipes.

- [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md)

### 🏗️ Building

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 🧪 Testing

```bash
mvn verify
```

## Available Recipes

The recipes are organized by code type and transformation phase:

| Type of Change | Client Code | Java Delegate | External Worker |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Prepare** | AllClientPrepareRecipes | AllDelegatePrepareRecipes | AllExternalWorkerPrepareRecipes |
| **Migrate** | AllClientMigrateRecipes | AllDelegateMigrateRecipes | AllExternalWorkerMigrateRecipes |
| **Cleanup** | AllClientCleanupRecipes | AllDelegateCleanupRecipes | AllExternalWorkerCleanupRecipes |
| **Combined** | AllClientRecipes | AllDelegateRecipes | AllExternalWorkerRecipes |

See the [user documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/migrating-from-camunda-7/code-conversion/#refactoring-recipes-using-openrewrite) for details on each recipe.
