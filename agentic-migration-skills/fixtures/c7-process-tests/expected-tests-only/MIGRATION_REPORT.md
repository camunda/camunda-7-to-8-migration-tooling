# Migration Report — Migrate tests only

## User choices

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Scope | Code + models |
| Target | Camunda 8.9 |
| Question 8 | Migrate tests only |

## Test execution decision

The skill ran `docker info` before Question 8. The command failed because Docker
was stopped. The skill still offered both **Run tests** and **Migrate tests
only**. The user chose **Migrate tests only**.

The migrated test sources compile with the command below. The skill ran no C7 or C8 test command
during migration. Each test check is blocked because the user declined test execution.

## Test verification

**Status:** `not verified (Migrate tests only)`

## Test-source compilation

| Scope | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Migrated test modules | `mvn -pl engine-tests test-compile`<br>`mvn -pl spring-boot-app test-compile`<br>`mvn -pl remote-engine test-compile` | passed |

## Test checks

| Check | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `test_baseline` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `test_parity` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `test_freeze` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `mock_boundary` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `process_coverage` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `test_execution` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |

## Deferred validation checks

| Kind | Scope | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests` | C7 `engine-tests`, `engine-tests-legacy`, `spring-boot-app`, and `remote-engine`; C8 `engine-tests`, `spring-boot-app`, and `remote-engine` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |
| `process_path` | `order`, `shipping`, `legacyOrder`, `fulfillment`, `MessageStartReview`, `MixedFinishReview`, `subscription`, `housekeeping`, and `payment` | blocked | declined by user (Question 8) |

## Test parity

The inventory and mapped CPT tests are present. Runtime parity remains
unverified because the user selected **Migrate tests only**.

## Verify the test migration

Baseline filesystem snapshot: `../c7-source-baseline/`

1. Run the C7 suites in `../c7-source-baseline/` with `mvn -pl engine-tests,engine-tests-legacy,spring-boot-app test`
   and `mvn -pl remote-engine verify`.
2. Start Docker. Run the migrated suites with `mvn -pl engine-tests,spring-boot-app test` and
   `mvn -pl remote-engine verify`.
3. Change only `test_run_mode` from `migrate_only` to `run` in
   `.camunda-migration/validation/step2-inventory.json`. Do not run `init`.
4. Record each check that the validator `report` action lists as missing. Record each
   `c7_baseline` check with the `block` action, and name the step 1 run in the reason.
5. Run the validator `report` action again. The gate stays `NOT READY` without a
   validator-captured C7 baseline.

## Readiness

**Verdict:** `needs review`

**Gate:** `NOT READY`

E9 and E10 remain manual retirements and need the approvals recorded in the
full-migration walkthrough. R2 remains manual because it uses a shared engine.
